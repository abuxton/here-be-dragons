<H1>Finishing</H1>
<P>Using a brush, coat the head with two layers of latex liquid rubber, letting
the first dry, before applying the second coat. Paint just onto the arrow shaft
for about 10mm. This helps to seal the head and make it more presentable for
use. Two layers of latex will usually last as long as your arrow will; any more
will just waste your time and add needless weight to the arrow. Black latex is
preferable as it covers better and is less obtrusive in colour than others in
the spectrum. Stipple the second coat with the brush (or a piece of sponge) in
order to acquire a cast metal image, and to eliminate brush strokes. You may
wish to dry brush the heads with silver acrylic paint to add a metal effect when
the latex is dry. If you do not, dust over each one lightly with talcum powder
to prevent them sticking to each other. Fresh dry latex can act a little like
contact adhesive! Do NOT latex over the end of the sponge foam (face 'A' on the
final diagram on foan head construction), as this does not allow air to escape
on impact when the arrow is shot, and it will tend to hurt the target more and
negate the effectiveness of the sponge buffer.</P>

<H2>Latex</H2>
<P>Latex is a thin white milky liquid, which may be coloured using any water
based paint; only a small amount is needed (about a tablespoon full in a small
coffee jar sized vessel!). Don't worry if it looks the wrong colour. The colour
will be apparent when the latex dries. Do not mix powder paint directly with
latex as it will tend to &quot;bead up&quot; and not mix very well. Mix powder
paint with water (adding the water to the powder slowly) until a nice smooth
single cream consistency is achieved, and then add this to the latex. Add latex
thickener to the latex liquid to improve the consistency. Add a small amount at
a time and mix until a double cream consistency is created. This allows a
thicker layer of latex to be applied in one coat (and stops the latex running
everywhere!)
</P>
<P>Store latex in a sealed vessel to prevent a skin forming. Do not allow latex
to reach freezing point, as it will start to separate. Latex is water soluble
only whilst liquid. Wash brushes out thoroughly in water after removing excess
latex on tissue paper. If small beads of dried latex have formed on the bristles
after washing, leave the brush to stand in some white spirit for a few hours.
Wipe the brush on tissue paper and wash it out in hot water mixed with a
generous squirt of washing up liquid. Rinse in fresh water afterwards. You may
find that a wire brush will help to remove solid latex from brush bristles
during cleaning. </P>

<TD>Cut two strips to wrap around the point of the arrow and slightly overlap.
Do not wrap the &quot;Gaffa&quot; level with the sponge tip, this tends to get a
little sharp around the edge, so set it back a few millimetres. Holding the
arrow upright, slice the tape from the edge all the way down to the end of the
cone forming a fringe.</TD></TR>
