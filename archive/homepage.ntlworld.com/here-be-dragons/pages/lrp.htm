      <p>This page is hoped to help answer some of the questions we often receive

        for interactive fantasy events. It's not intended to be all inclusive.

  Matthew Morgan's very informative guide, and relevant to everyone for checking 
  their own weapons, as well as for events weapons checkers

    Graham trained at the Second Skin workshop and to my mind is the best commercial 
    weapons maker available at the moment, particularly for custom weapons</li>
  <li><a href="safety.htm">Essential Safety Considerations for Melee Weapon Construction</a><br>
    One of the big conventions organisers recently asked the various weapons makers 
    to produce guidelines on safety standards for weapon construction. After a 
    great deal of thought this is the Second Skin guide on the things that are 
    really important, when making a weapon, based on about 15 years of LRP weapons 
    construction. It is intended to supplement the various &quot;How To ...&quot; 
    guides that are available, not replace them, and should also be of use to 
    weapons checkers, but I must stress that the guidelines on weapons padding 
    etc are for what we have found to be the <b>minimum</b> acceptable amount.</li>

  This article has been published elsewhere without our knowledge or consent,

  how to make masks from moulds sold by Second Skin, and is therefore a little 
  out of date. We are in the process of updating and expanding it to include such 
  areas as life-casting, sculpting and mould-making. So watch this space!
