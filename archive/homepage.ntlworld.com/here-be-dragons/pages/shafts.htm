<H1>ARROW SHAFTS</H1>
<H2>Cutting to length.</H2>
<P>Before you even start to cut the shafts, whether they are proper Port Orford
Cedar (POC) shafts or dowels, test each one by flexing  the arrow shaft a little
to check that it is not cracked, split or broken and that it is sound to use for
LRP arrows.
</P>
<P> The next stage is to cut a taper on <U>one</U> end of the arrow shaft with
a shaft cutter, to allow the fitting of the nock later on. The shaft cutter
resembles a large pencil sharpener and is used in much the same way. Ensure that
you have the correct sized cutter for the shafts you are using. If you don't the
nocks will not fit properly, and your arrow may fly badly.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Taper all your shafts <U>on one end only</U></STRONG> 
</P>
<P>You may wish to cut the shafts to suit your own draw length. Your draw
length is the distance from the nocking point on the bow string, to approx' 1&quot;
in front of the arrow rest on the bow when it is drawn. For LRP arrows, we have
to measure to the front of the bow and add 21/2&quot; or approx' 65mm to allow
space for the foam head. You will probably find that you can afford to cut about
2&quot; off the length of a standard 32&quot; arrow shaft. Get someone to help
you measure this distance accurately though. It is not necessary to cut the
shafts to length but it has a few advantages.
</P>
<P>The first is that they will not stick out of your quiver so far! The second
is they will gain a little stiffness and strength and will probably shoot
better, and be less delicate under foot after being shot in encounters. Whatever
you do, try to ensure that all your arrows are the same length. This will aid
your accuracy. Different length arrows tend to fly differently. Use a small
junior hacksaw to cut your shafts. Ensure that you do it carefully. Do not
splinter the ends of the shafts. If you do, use a fine file or sand paper, and
clean up any damage. Try and keep the sawn end as flat as possible.
</P>
<P>DO <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> ROUND OFF THE END OF THE SHAFT!
</P>
<P>A flat ended shaft helps to distribute the load exerted by the shaft on the
inside face of the foam head.  Cross bow bolts need to be flat at both ends, and
sanded as described above.
</P>
<P>The bolt shaft should be long enough to slide along the bow up to the stop,
with approx' 65mm (21/2&quot; inches) standing proud of the front of the
crossbow, on which to build the foam head.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Sealing.</H2>
<P>Paint the arrow shafts with car spray paint, lacquer or similar wood
sealant. This is your opportunity to get artistic, as you can paint the arrows
any colour you wish. You could use a stain first to give the shafts an antique
look, and seal them with a clear varnish/lacquer afterwards. You may find though
that white is the most useful finish, allowing the arrow to be visible in
undergrowth etc for easy retrieval after encounters. I advise you apply one coat
and allow it to dry. Rub over the surface with wire wool to remove any
roughness, and give the shafts a second coat. This gives the arrows a reasonably
good finish and seals them quite well. You may find that giving them a third
coat after rubbing down the second also, will improve the finish even more.
</P>
<P>When taking the time to make a good set of arrows, it is preferable to seal
the wood well, as this prevents damp etc from warping the shaft. The smoother
and straighter your arrows are, the better they will shoot, and the safer they
will be.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Fletching.</H2>
<P>Each arrow will require three fletchings, and each crossbow bolt two.
Fletchings come in a range of colours, sizes and materials. Feather fletchings
are the most authentic, and pleasing to the eye, but are not the most durable
(particularly in the rain). Plastic fletchings can be too stiff, tending to
break away from the shaft along the glue line if roughly used. They can also be
a little dangerous if they catch exposed skin in flight, sometimes inflicting
wounds similar to paper cuts! The most durable are the rubber variety. They are
very flexible, do not tend to break off, and retain their shape even if the
arrows are pushed in a quiver fletchings first! The best length for arrow
fletchings is about 4&quot; or 5&quot; (inches), and 3&quot; or 4&quot; for
bolts. This provides a good stable guidance for the shaft with what will be a
rather bulky foam head on the point end. However, the longer the fletchings, the
more wind resistant drag they cause (slowing down the arrow) and the more
expensive they are - something to consider if you loose a lot of arrows! I find
that even if an arrow gets broken, feather fletchings can be cut from the shafts
with a sharp knife along the glue line; with the quills sanded smooth they are
almost as good as new, and are able to be used on a new set of arrows.
</P>
<P>Do not bother using flu-flu's unless you particularly wish to slow down your
arrow tremendously, and loose accuracy. They don't really have the guidance
quality for an arrow with heads as large as those used in LRP; they are designed
for bird shooting at close range, so that they slow down very quickly for easy
retreival if they miss the target.
</P>
<P>A fletching jig will put all your fletchings on in exactly the same way,
which will allow your arrow to fly far more accurately. However, the process can
be done by hand if you do not feel that you can afford a jig, or that you will
not be making enough arrows to justify the purchase. The hand method (using
dressmaking pins)is less accurate, but can provide good results with practice.

      this process with the other two fletchings, spacing them evenly around the 
      shaft. Finally check that all the fletchings are positioned correctly, and 
      that the quills are touching the shaft evenly allowing the glue to bond.

<TD>This means the arrow will run across the bow in a flat plane. You may wish

<TD> After the fletching glue has cured for about 6 hours, the end of the
fletching requires paring down with a craft knife, to prevent it lifting. A rub
with a small piece of fine sandpaper and a smear of clear glue or varnish will
finish this off perfectly.</TD></TR></TABLE>
