<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>Welcome to the <B>Second Skin LRP arrow making guide MK III</B>, as revised
for the internet. It's been about seven years since the original was first
written, and three or so since the second edition, so it seemed about time for
an update for the electronic age.  The Mark II paper edition is still available,
if you want the full version - complete with the idiots guide of what NOT to do,
and a few other bits, which in the interests of your 'phone bills, are not
included here.
</P>
<P>You may think there are already too many arrow guides available on the
internet.  Unfortuntely these all seem to be based on our first edition guide
which is merely a very basic instruction on what to do to construct a safe LRP
arrow.  They do not really explain<STRONG>WHY</STRONG> this is the safest way
we have found to construct an arrow.  This guide is substantially more
informative, detailed and thorough than our original, variations of which you
may have seen on the net previously. 
</P>
<P>If you understand why you use a certain construction method, you should know
what changes you can safely make. 
</P>
<P>Our main concern is safety and quality, and this is the reason for what you
are reading now!  Mike Stringer has paid a great deal of attention to the
concept of arrow safety in LRP and, being an experienced  archer (shooting since
the age of 7), he has endeavoured to perfect the design, since he and Andi
Coulton first developed the LRP arrow, back in 1985/86.  We hope that you find
this guide of value. Feel free to download it for personal use, just don't
reproduce it in any other form or for commercial use without our consent.
</P>
<P>Please read it through carefully and completely more than once, to
familiarise yourself with all the relevant procedures before you attempt to
construct anything! 
</P>
<P><STRONG>This is not the definitive answer to safe arrows in live role
playing. It can not be held accountable for any accidents or injuries caused
from equipment made after reading it. YOU are the one who will make the arrows,
and it is YOU who are doing the shooting.</STRONG>
</P>
<P>I hope that you will find this guide informative and useful. If you feel
that some of the information is misleading in any way, please feel free to
contact <A HREF="mailto:caroline@here-be-dragons.demon.co.uk">us</A> for
advice.
</P>
<P>Enjoy making your arrows. Happy shooting...           Mike and Caroline</P>

<H2>The LRP Arrow</H2>
<P>What do we need from an arrow usable for live role-playing combat?  
Firstly, and most importantly we need an arrow design which is as safe and
durable as possible. Secondly, we do not want to compromise the accuracy of the
arrow too greatly with over bulky head designs. We want an arrow that is as
accurate as we can possibly shoot.  Lastly we want it to be fairly cost
effective. Why? Arrows get broken, usually under foot in combat situations.
Ready made arrows become expensive, especially if you tend to have a breakage
rate of 50%+ per adventure! They are fairly time consuming to make, and
therefore retail at a high price from manufacturers. Many people want to make
their own arrows anyway, and many others have to for the above financial
reasons.  If you can make your own safely and correctly, it will only cost you
the price of the materials, and you will be in a position to make new ones
whenever you want (and it can be fun!) </P>
<P>In any live role-playing environment, there is only one safe size for an
arrow point to be, and that is large enough to prevent a hit in the eye from
being detrimental to that most precious part of the body. The most appropriate
size I have found is around 50mm (2&quot; inches) in diameter. If the head is
any larger than that, it simply slows down the arrow and spoils its accuracy;
Any smaller, and the head becomes a dangerous size for eyes. For this reason, I
cannot recommend a head diameter any less than 40mm minimum. 
</P>
<P>The head of an LRP arrow must be soft enough for a close range shot not to
damage delicate areas of the body (to account for unforeseen accidents). It must
be constructed to be robust, long lasting, and eliminate all possibilities of
the arrow shaft punching through the foam to the outside world. If this were to
happen, the possibility of someone being impaled by an LRP arrow would be very
real indeed! This must be avoided at all cost as the future of the hobby depends
upon it.</P>
<P><STRONG>IF YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO MAKE YOUR ARROWS CORRECTLY AND WITH
CARE...DON'T BOTHER MAKING THEM AT ALL
</STRONG></P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/arrows.gif"></P>
<P>  For the sake of this guide, we will call the foam point on the end of the
arrow that we are going to make <STRONG>- THE HEAD</STRONG>. This way nobody
can get too confused about sharp points, foam points etc! In most cases I will
be referring to arrows in LRP, but of course, much of the following information
is equally pertinent to crossbow bolts also.
</P>
<P>Incidentally, if you have never shot a bow before, why are you reading this?
Please, for the sake of everyone concerned, take some lessons from someone who
knows what they're talking about with respect to archery before you start
shooting at people with LRP arrows! Oh, but please, don't fall for the old
classic of &quot;I'm a trained instructor&quot;. Use your judgement when
choosing a mentor; certificates and courses are all very well, but they're a
poor substitute for aptitude and common sense.
</P>
<P>To be a safe archer, you need to be a competent archer. Knowing one end of a
bow and arrow from the other, and being able to generally hit what you're aiming
at is competent. Hanging great big stabilisers and sights off a &#163;300.00 bow
in fancy competitions does not necessarily mean you're competent; it means
you're rich! Shooting a bow is not as easy as shooting a gun. It will take you a
little time to get the hang of it, but if you're keen enough, you'll grasp the
concept soon enough...Have patience, and have fun.
</P>
<P><STRONG>REMEMBER, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS! IF YOU ARE IN
DOUBT ABOUT ANYTHING...CHECK IT OUT! - PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US FOR ADVICE</STRONG>

</P>
<P>Nothing in this world is guaranteed. Bows and arrows are killing tools and
must be treated with the utmost seriousness and care. Once you let that arrow
fly it's out of your hands, and no matter how good you are at archery, fate will
play it's part one way or another.</P>
