<h2>What is a Prosthetic Application?</h2>
The terms Prosthetic Appliance or Prosthesis refer to a piece of three dimensional 
body make-up, moulded in skin or foam latex, gelatine, silicone or similar special 
make-up materials. When adhered to the skin in the correct way, a Prosthesis is 
designed to achieve a realistic visual alteration to any specific body area as 
required.
<p>Any design of Prosthesis is possible from simple scars, ears, and noses, to 
  false limbs, heads and teeth! For a Prosthetic item to work properly, it should 
  be made specifically for individual customers, from accurate casts made from 
  the appropriate body area. This is a time consuming and expensive process, and 
  therefore simple items are designed to be fairly generic, made in skin Latex, 
  to fit a wide range of individuals. </p>

<h2>Equipment </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The relevant Prosthetic</li>
  <li> A Prosthetic adhesive or Latex liquid rubber<br>
  </li>
  <li>A specific adhesive Remover - For removing specialist Prosthetic adhesives 
    from the </li>
  <li>skin. Latex does not require a Remover as it will simply peel off (except 
    from hair where an oil based remover will help)</li>
  <li> Liquid Latex</li>
  <li> One or two medium sized soft flat artists paintbrushes<br>
  </li>
  <li>One or two pieces of Sponge or Foam Rubber (or specialist foam latex make-up 
    sponges)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Cotton wool and cotton buds<br>
  </li>
  <li>Relevant colours of Greasepaint, and/or Foundation make-up. Rubber Mask 
    greasepaint (RMG) is preferable, as it is designed specifically for application 
    onto </li>
  <li>Latex and similar Prosthetic materials<br>
  </li>
  <li>Translucent make-up powder<br>
  </li>
  <li>A dark flesh tone, or black make-up powder/eye shadow<br>
  </li>
  <li>A powder puff and powder brush</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above items are available from make-up suppliers and pharmacists.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p><b>NB:- </B>The thin irregular edges should be left on the Prosthesis. They 
  are designed to allow the Appliance to be blended in properly and realistically 
  with the skin. Check that the item fits you comfortably before adhering it. 
  If some of the edges are restricting the fitting, and/or feel uncomfortable, 
  you will have to trim them. <b>DO NOT USE SCISSORS</b> unless the edge is not 
  going to be seen (such as behind ears etc). To trim edges, hold the edge of 
  the Prosthetic firmly with one hand, just inboard of the area to be removed, 
  and carefully pull the excess material off with the other hand. Only remove 
  a small amount at a time, and ensure that you hold firmly to prevent tearing 
  off more of the edge than is required.&nbsp; Take the time to understand exactly 
  how the item fits so that you will be able to apply it correctly first time.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>
<p>Ensure that none of the thin edges are curled or folded under each other, as 
  this will make the blending in process later, far more difficult. For large 
  (e.g. Facial) Appliances, using a brush, paint the inside edges (which touch 
  the skin) with adhesive or Latex. Take special care to paint up to the very 
  edge. Paint the corresponding body area and allow both to touch dry. Line the 
  Prosthetic up carefully with the body area and press firmly into position, and 
  be careful with your positioning as you do not get a second chance! </p>
<p>For small or complex items such as Ears, simply paint the inside edges as above, 
  and position carefully on the relevant body area whilst the adhesive is still 
  wet. Press gently into place and allow to dry. </p>
<p>After a few minutes press again firmly into place, and the Prosthesis should 
  adhere to the skin in the same manner as above. Many Prosthetic adhesives and 
  Latex either dry clear or change to a darker colour when dry. The drying process 
  may be speeded up by the gentle application of heat from a hair dryer or similar 
  warm air source.</p>
<p>Whatever method is being employed, when the item is in position, ensure that 
  all the edges are fully glued down to allow the blending process to be achieved. 
  Keep all brushes in the Adhesive or Latex during use. Latex may be washed out 
  of brushes in cold water, as too may &quot;Pros-Aide&quot; or &quot;Pro-Stik&quot; 
  Adhesives. Spirit Gum and other Prosthetic Adhesives must be cleaned out in 
  the appropriate Remover. DO NOT ALLOW ADHESIVE OR LATEX SOAKED BRUSHES TO DRY! 
  If this occurs, allow the brush to stand for an hour or so in the relevant Remover 
  or white spirit, and brush out the softened Adhesive/Latex if necessary with 
  a wire brush. Wash the brushes in hot soapy water and rinse in warm water. </p>
<p align="center"><b>- DO NOT ALLOW WHITE SPIRIT NEAR THE APPLIANCE. White spirit 
  is a solvent for cured/dry Latex </b>-</p>
<h2 align="left">Blending</h2>
<p>When the Prosthesis is in position, take a small piece of clean dry sponge, 
  and stipple a small quantity of Latex around the Appliance where the edges meet 
  the skin, adding a subtle texture as you work...Allow to dry.</p>
<h2 align="left"> </h2>
<h2 align="left">Colour</h2>
<p>To create the finished effect, the colour of the Appliance should be matched 
  to that of the skin or vice versa. Using Greasepaint, RMG, or Foundation make-up 
  and a piece of clean dry sponge, stipple the Prosthesis, working around the 
  edges and onto the skin. Various shades should be used to give the image a realistic 
  feeling of depth. Paint brushes may be employed to deal with any fine details. 
  A dark make-up powder or eye shadow of the appropriate colour, may be used for 
  toning using a powder brush if your RMG/Foundation colour range is limited. 
  If possible, it is advisable to keep separate brushes and sponges for individual 
  colours in your make-up kit. Hot soapy water or a specialist Remover may be 
  used for cleaning colours from brushes etc.</p>
<p>When the colour work is complete, use a clean powder puff and press a <u>small 
  amount</u> of translucent make-up powder at a time, into the greasepaint on 
  the skin and Prosthesis to remove the tack and gloss. Keep working until the 
  gloss has gone and there are no signs of powder. Excess powder may be dusted 
  away with a powder brush.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Removal</h2>
<p>If Latex was used as an Adhesive, the Prosthesis may be simply peeled from 
  the skin. If an alternative Adhesive was used, soak around the edges of the 
  Appliance with a piece of Cotton wool soaked in the appropriate Remover and 
  leave for a minute or two. Next, carefully work under and around the edges with 
  a cotton bud or paint brush soaked in the same Remover and gently work the Prosthetic 
  Appliance off the skin. Leave the Appliance face down on a working surface. 
  Clean off any remaining Adhesive and other make-up from the skin with appropriate 
  Removers, and wash thoroughly with soap and warm water. The use of a good quality 
  moisturiser may be advisable to prevent the skin from being dried out by the 
  make-up materials used earlier. Clean the back of the Prosthesis with Remover 
  or peel if Latex Adhesive was used, and also peel excess Latex from around the 
  edges. Allow the item to dry out if necessary, and then de-tack the back with 
  powder or Talc. -Store carefully for future use- </p>
