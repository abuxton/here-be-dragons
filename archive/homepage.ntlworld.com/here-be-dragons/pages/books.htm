These are some of the books I have found useful for research and costume making 
for LRP. As costume books tend to be rather expensive I found most of these in 
either the public libraries (most will get you anything you order if it is obtainable) 
or at second-hand bookshops. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Period Costume for Stage and Screen: patterns for women's dress</b><br>
    Volume 1 1500-1800 (ISBN 0-88 734-610-3) Players Press<br>
    Volume 2 1800-1909 (ISBN 0-88734-609-X) Players Press<br>
    Medieval-1500 (ISBN 0-88734-653-7) Players Press<br>
    Jean Hunniset <br>
    These include informative text, patterns and detailed instruction on how to 
    make the costumes, from the corset up. Very good &quot;big frocks&quot;, and 
    the Tudor/Elizabethan overrobes are good for anything. I think these are about 
    £35.00 each, but well worth getting from the library. Good general construction 
    details as well. The medieval book includes italian renaissance dresses to 
    die for!<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Patterns of Fashion 3(1560-1620)</strong><br>
    Arnold, J (ISBN 0333 382845) Macmillan<br>
    Drawings of men's and women's clothing showing their construction and detailed 
    patterns. Not for the beginner to construct, but good for inspiration and 
    to copy some elements.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Evolution of Fashion 1066-1930</b><br>
    H Hamilton-Hill &amp; P Bucknell (ISBN 0 7134 5818 6) Batsford<br>
    Line drawings, description and patterns for men and women's dress. Good for 
    LRP as this book covers the norman and medieaval periods.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>English Costume of the Early Middle Ages</b><br>
    <strong>English Costume of the Later Middle Ages</strong><br>
    <strong>English Costume in the Age of Elizabeth</strong><br>
    Iris Brooke<br>
    The above are all part of a series covering English costume. They include 
    black and white drawings, with some in colour, of costume in chronological 
    order, with a description. They may not be that correct historically (according 
    to some of the comments in the historical costuming FAQ), but provide useful 
    LRP inspiration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Costume 1066-1966</strong><br>
    Peacock, John (ISBN 0-5000-27404-5)Thames &amp; Hudson <br>
    Detailed line drawings of men and women's costume. I think there is now a 
    new edition, taking the period covered up to the 1990s.</li>
</ul>
