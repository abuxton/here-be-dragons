<H1>Bow Use</H1>
<P>The most appropriate bows for use in LRP are the fibreglass practice bows
which most archery suppliers will stock. These products are available in a range
of styles, are reasonably inexpensive, and more importantly, are very durable.
</P>
<P>In the main, I would advise against using a wooden, laminated or recurve bow
in LRP. These types of bows are designed for normal archery conditions where
they are unlikely to take much physical damage. Laminated wooden and self wood
bows (single piece long bows etc) if chipped or scratched can quite easily
develop cracks and splits when stressed, and will subsequently break.
</P>
<P>A bow is basically a large spring, and the forces that are at work when it
is drawn (bent when the string is pulled back) are tremendous. This being the
case, any defect such as a chip in an edge of the limb of a bow may cause what
is termed as a &quot;stress raiser&quot;. When a bow breaks it can easily cause
considerable damage to the head of the user, and if he/she is unlucky, damage to
an eye.
</P>
<P>On a more trivial note, the appearance of a laminated recurve bow may often
be visually inappropriate to the LRP hobby. As with fibreglass practice bows,
covering/detailing the bow with foam and leather etc will help to &quot;fantasize&quot;
the image, as well as performing a practical function. The leather on the limb
of the bow, will help to protect it from getting scratched and chipped, and
alleviate the dangers as described above.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Bow Poundage</H2>
<P>Ensure that the draw weight does not exceed 30lbs (pounds). This is a little
figure that is written on the bottom limb of your bow, and determines the speed
at which the arrow is projected (and the force with which it hits the target)
when you let go of the string. The figure is often calibrated for a draw length
of 28&quot; (inches). Different clubs may have lower draw weight
recommendations, but I would not advise a weight any greater than 30lbs @ 28&quot;.
In the past, under certain appropriate conditions, I have used a bow of a higher
poundage with LRP arrows, and they have proved to be totally safe; again it's a
matter of common sense, skill with a bow, and more importantly, careful and
thoughtful arrow construction.
</P>
<P>If you are not sure what poundage your bow is, or you feel that the figure
written on the bow may be wrong (yes this can happen), you can find out for sure
as follows.  Obtain a fish weighing scale, the sort with a ring on one end, a
hook on the other and a sliding weight scale (preferably in Imperial/English
pounds-lbs) in between. Secure the scale by the ring from a solid object such as
a roof beam (or get a strong friend to help). Hang the strung bow by the string
about its centre (where you would nock an arrow) from the hook on the scales.
Pull the bow down by the handle until the distance between the nocking point and
the arrow rest measures 27 inches (use a ruler or tape measure to check) reading
the weight on the scales as you do so. This is the bows average draw weight.
</P><IMG SRC="../images/scales.gif">
<P>Alternatively, if you take your bow to a reputable archery shop such as
Quicks archery, they will be happy to test the bow for you. You should really
test your bow at your draw length.</P>

<TD><IMG SRC="../images/length.gif" ALT="Draw length" ALIGN="left"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P> This figure may be more or less than 28&quot;. As a rough guide, the draw
weight of your bow will increase/decrease by approx' 2lbs per inch around its
calibrated draw weight. Eg:- If your draw length is 26&quot;, A 30lb bow,
calibrated at 28&quot; will effectively shoot your arrow with a force of
approximately 26lbs!
</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
<HR>
<H2>Crossbows</H2>
<P>With reference to crossbows, I would advise that the only really viable
design for LRP use is the Barnett &quot;Phantom&quot; pistol crossbow. The prod
or bow part of the unit is approx' 30lbs draw weight, and I have found them to
be quite safe even at close range at sensitive body areas.
</P>
<P>Crossbows are dynamically inefficient machines particularly at range, due to
the relative shortness of their prods (spring/bow section) compared with their
larger bow cousins. As a useful weapon, a crossbow relies purely on its power
and simplicity of use, rather than its prod/spring design. The &quot;Phantom&quot;
performs quite well over a reasonable range however, and anything stronger would
be rather ineffective anyway at range, as the length of the bolts tend to loose
stability over distance with such a large foam head on them.
</P>
<P>The danger problem for LRP with crossbows is that, unlike bows, one cannot
half draw them at close range and reduce the force of the bolts' impact, hence
the necessity to keep the draw weight low.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Arrow Safety </H2>
<P>Think about what you are doing! How LRP has managed to avoid a fatal
accident is beyond me, based on what certain people in the hobby believe to be &quot;safe&quot;
weapons and circumstances.
</P>
<P>To test an LRP arrow or indeed a cross bow bolt to determine if it is safe
to shoot in LRP combat, proceed as follows:-
</P>
<P>a) Check that the arrow head is approximately 50mm in diameter, and feel
firmly with your fingers and/or thumb for any defects in the construction of the
head (hard protrusions such as the arrow shaft working its way through the foam,
or sharp or hard debris embedded in the head) and ensure that there is
sufficient padding foam on the end.
</P>
<P>b) Check that the head is not loose on the end of the arrow shaft, and that
it can NOT be pulled off....<BR> DO NOT, HOWEVER, TRY AND RIP THE ARROW HEAD TO
BITS! USE YOUR COMMON SENSE AND SENSITIVITY. <BR> Removable points save money
but may cost lives! Think about it...
</P>
<P>c) Ensure that there is a good strong barrier (thick car tyre inner tube
rubber or a 2p piece) built into the head to prevent the arrow shaft working its
way through the foam padding! Also check that some idiot hasn't left a metal
point on the arrow that the head is built around! If you can't tell, ask whoever
made it. If they're stupid enough to do it, they're stupid enough to tell you!
</P>
<P>d) Check that the nock on the arrow shaft is not broken or loose somehow
(which could cause a misfire).
</P>
<P>e) Check that the fletchings are all firmly attached, and that they do not
have any sharp leading edges.</P>
<P>f) Flex the arrow shaft a little to check that it is not cracked, split or
broken. -

<H2>Checking Arrows at an Event</H2>
<P>If you are ever asked to check arrows at an event:
</P>
<P><B>Do not let your ego fly away with you, you're there to do a responsible
job, not play god!</B> 
</P>
<P>It may be prudent to ask the maker of any arrows you are testing, to show
you a cross section of the sort of heads they are supplying (have supplied); not
a specially made cross section of course, but a standard arrow head as supplied
on their normal LRP arrows, which has been cut down the centre to reveal its
construction. If a cross section is not available, I would advise that you
discourage the sale of the arrows until one is, and/or you are totally certain
of their construction. You could ask the purchaser of the arrows to allow you to
cut one of theirs open, but it would be preferable to ask the<STRONG> SUPPLIER</STRONG>,
remember, you could be saving someone's life! If they don't agree, or do not
have any stock available, cut one of the purchaser's arrows open, and ensure
that the supplier or manufacturer recompenses the purchaser directly.
</P>
<H4>You should not risk the use of any questionable arrows on site. </H4>
<P>It should not be the purchaser who must prove the safety of what he or she
has bought....although he/she should be aware of what constitutes a viable and
safe arrow or crossbow bolt, and should always be prepared to fully co-operate
with any investigations which could save lives!
</P>
<P>The responsibility is first and foremost with the<STRONG> maker</STRONG> of
LRP arrows to prove his/her commitment to safety within the live role playing
hobby.
</P>
<P>If you've made a set of arrows, always ensure that you can supply a cross
section yourself! Remember the old &quot;do unto others maxim&quot;-
</P>
<H4>DO NOT PASS LRP ARROWS IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO THEIR SAFE CONSTRUCTION -
YOU COULD SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE! </H4>
