<H1>Karimat Method.</H1>
<P>Using a camping mat, mark out and cut four 40mm squares and two 50mm squares
(as the mat is only about 10mm thick you have to double up the number of pieces
required per arrow and glue them together). Glue the squares together using
contact adhesive to make two 40mm squares each approx' 20mm thick, and one 50mm
square approx' 20mm thick. Do not try and cut corners by using a glue gun! This
makes a very bad, untidy, difficult to carve mess! 
</P>
<P>Set aside the 50mm square block for later use. Treat the two 40mm squares as
the sides of the cone, and proceed as described in the Plastazote method. You
should work through the process until you have a 40mm diameter circular cone
glued onto the end of the arrow shaft. Adhere the rubber as described
previously, and also glue on the 50mm block of Karimat set aside earlier. 
</P>
<P>The block you have just glued on, being 50mm in diameter, will be larger
than the 40mm cone it is now attached to. In this case, because we require a
50mm diameter head, you must carve the block in a circular shape, following the
shape of the cone as with the Plastazote method, but you must angle your knife
outwards a little to create a finished end diameter of 50mm. Therefore, instead
of creating a parallel disc on the end of the cone, you have almost continued
the shape of the cone right to the end of the head. Add the upholstery foam as
described earlier. That's it... All you have to do is practice, and follow this
procedure for any amount of arrows you wish to create.
