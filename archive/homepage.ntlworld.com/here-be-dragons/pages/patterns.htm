<p>Everyone who makes costume for LRP has their own favorite
patterns, which with a bit of a tweek, are used as the basis of
just about every piece of costume you make. So here are the
patterns I've been using over the last few years, and can
heartily recommend for LRP costume-making.</p>

<h3>Vogue 7110</h3>

<p>A very easy cloak pattern which is quick to make (2 hours if
you're in a real rush) and easy enough for even the most anxious
beginner. It does take a lot of material, but believe me, in
winter you, and a friend, may be glad of it!</p>

<h3>Style 1884</h3>

<p>This is actually a wedding dress, and as such makes a good
&quot;big frock&quot; for an event - several using this pattern
are usually seen at events like Renewal or the Gathering. It is a
lot easier to make than you might think It can also be adapted
easily to make a general purpose bodice or top. I made it in soft
leather, and with leggings and a belt is great for a fighter, but
with the addition of a long skirt it looks formal and suitable
even for a mage or healer.</p>

<h3>New Look 6043</h3>

<p>This is another party frock pattern, but the off the shoulder option, with 
  long tight sleeves helps give it a fantasy air. It can also be slashed down 
  the front of the bodice and laced up with eyelets and cord or ribbon.</p>
