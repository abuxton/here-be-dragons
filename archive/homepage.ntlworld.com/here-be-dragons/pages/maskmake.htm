<p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Latex is a thin milky 
  liquid which is water and ammonia based. It can be thinned if necessary with 
  water, this can tend to reduce its strength slightly. The ammonia content aids 
  its drying capacity. The higher the ammonia content, the faster the drying process. 
  When dry, latex tends to be a translucent brown, but can appear clear in thin 
  layers.</span> </p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Latex when it is 
  dry and cured WILL NOT be dissolved by water. In fact it is affected by very 
  few chemicals. To remove latex from brushes etc, they must either be washed 
  out in water whilst the latex is still wet, or if it has dried, they may be 
  soaked in white spirit or paraffin for a few hours. This has the affect of dislodging 
  and degrading the dried latex allowing it to be wire brushed out of the bristles. 
  This is best achieved in a solution of soapy water (preferably hot water and 
  washing up liquid) to remove the white spirit residue. Once clear of latex, 
  the brushes should be rinsed in cold fresh water, thus returning them to their 
  former glory.</span></p>

font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Any water based paint 
  may be added to latex, never use a copper based pigment, as this will rapidly 
  age it, causing it to go sticky and rot! Most gold, copper and bronze type paints 
  have a copper base. For Mask making, the paint should be added to the latex 
  before pouring/painting. Only a small amount is needed (approx' 1 teaspoon per 
  cup of latex!). The latex will not appear to be the correct colour in its liquid 
  form, but when it dries at the required thickness, the colour will be apparent. 
  This process allows you to know when the latex is cured!</span></p>

font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>To create a mask, 
  first ensure that the plaster mould is dry, clean and free from dust, old latex 
  etc. Mix the required colour of pigment with your latex. This should be done 
  with a brush in an open bowl.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>WARNING, 
  LATEX CAN GIVE OFF FUMES, WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA!</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>The reason for the 
  brush and open bowl is to allow a thorough mixing of pigment into the latex. 
  Poster paints and the like (most suited to pigmenting latex given their cost 
  effectiveness) tend to be quite thick, and can remain as a sediment in the bottom 
  of mixing vessels if one does not take care. Never mix pigment into a bottle 
  of latex by shaking! This causes too many air bubbles which can be transferred 
  onto your mould surface. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>When the pigment 
  is mixed, pour the latex into your mould SLOWLY to reduce air pockets. Tap the 
  mould with your hand to vibrate air bubbles/pockets from within the liquid. 
  Leave the latex to stand in the mould for 2 - 6 hours depending upon the thickness 
  of the mask required. The plaster mould draws moisture from the latex allowing 
  a thickness to build up on the inside of the mould, in proportion to the time 
  the liquid latex is left in it. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Sometimes your masks 
  will appear to have an air bubble pitted skin texture, this occurs when the 
  air in the plaster mould is being replaced by liquid in the casting process. 
  To eliminate this effect, when the latex is first poured into the mould, leave 
  for a few minutes and pour it out. Stipple the bubbles seen in the latex layer 
  remaining out with a brush, and before the latex starts to dry fill the mould 
  up and leave for the requisite amount of time.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Afterwards, carefully 
  pour off the latex into a bowl and leave the mould to drain for 10 minutes upside 
  down on a plastic sheet. Pour the spare latex into a screw top container to 
  preserve it for future use. Turn the mould onto its base to allow air to contact 
  with the inside of the mould. Leave to cure for 12 hours or so. The latex will 
  be cured when the colour of the mask becomes apparent, when the surface is dry, 
  and when the latex no longer feels soft under the dry surface. If in doubt, 
  try peeling a portion of the mask to check the state of the latex.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Using a dry brush, 
  dust some talcum powder inside the mould. This will prevent the latex sticking 
  to itself on removal. Gently peel the mask from within, being careful not to 
  break away any fine detail from the mould. When the mask is withdraw, areas 
  such as eyes and mouths can be trimmed out with scissors ready for painting 
  etc.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>There are three types 
  of moulds that you are likely to be making masks with. The first is a half face, 
  the second is a two part mould, the third is a one piece jointed, and finally 
  a joint-less mould.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>HALF FACE moulds will require the neck end blocking 
  out for pouring purposes, as will two part moulds. Two part moulds are the same 
  as making two half face masks, a back and a front latex mask is made and joined 
  together afterwards. The necks of the moulds can be blocked with clay, plasticine 
  or more permanently with plaster of paris. A small tray of a suitable shape 
  being filled about an inch in depth with plaster and the mould being gently 
  placed into it. A tray can be made with tin foil, clay or plasticine if one 
  of the correct size is not available.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Plaster of paris, 
  dental plaster, herculite or similar material are all suitable for this purpose. 
  The powder is simply mixed with water into a creamy paste and cures in approx' 
  10 minutes by generating its own heat. Rough plaster edges may be trimmed up 
  with a joiners rasp or course file.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Use of thickener</span></u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>If one does not wish 
  to try and block the neck of a mould, there are two other ways to build up latex 
  in plaster moulds. Once pigment has been added to the latex, latex thickener 
  may also be added (only a small amount is required) to turn the latex to a thick 
  creamy consistency. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>The correct viscosity 
  must be attained to allow the latex to be painted in the mould with a brush, 
  without it running into the recesses. The appropriate thickness of latex must 
  then be painted into the mould in one application, to generate the desired thickness 
  of mask. This is then left to dry in the same way as pouring. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Alternatively, the mask can be built up layer by 
  layer. As every layer is painted on, it is allowed to dry. This method is best 
  employed with a lamination of material. Three fairly thin even layers of slightly 
  thickened latex are painted into the mould and left to dry in between each layer. 
  After the third layer is dry, a fourth is painted in, and small 30mm square 
  patches of thin cotton  material are painted in with it, overlapping each one. 
  The material must be fully stippled in with latex and no air spaces allowed 
  to remain. If the material is dry in the middle, a lamination has failed to 
  be made, and the material serves no purpose. Straps can be laminated in at this 
  stage if required. This fourth layer is left to dry, and two further layers 
  is added and the mask is removed as above. This results in a very strong robust 
  mask. The process can be speeded up by drying the latex layers with a hair dryer, 
  or over a heater etc. Gentle warmth is preferred, don't get the latex too hot!</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Joining masks</span></u><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> - From two part moulds. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>When the back and front moulds do not join, the 
  mask must be joined afterwards. On removal of the back and front parts of the 
  mask, the joining edges should be carefully trimmed up with scissors, and the 
  outside of the two halves joined together with carpet/gaffa tape. The inside 
  of the joint is then painted with latex, and material laminated into it as above.  
  Once dry, two further coats are then added. When they are dry and talc dusted, 
  the carpet tape is carefully removed, and the joint on the outside is carefully 
  blended in with thickened latex. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>ONE PIECE JOINTED 
  MOULDS require carefully locating together, and holding together with webbing 
  straps employing one way rucksack clips. This allows you to pull the straps 
  very tight and hold the mould firmly together. At least two per mould is advisable. 
  Good thick string or rope using slip knots is acceptable if straps are un - 
  available. The joints are very rarely perfect, it is therefore advisable to 
  seal the joint with clay or plasticine before pouring in the latex as described 
  on page 2.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>When the mask is 
  removed, it will need the joint carefully trimming off with sharp scissors. 
  If one has access to a small modellers drill, a dentists silicone bull nose 
  grinding tool will remove the remaining flash perfectly.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>JOINTLESS MOULDS 
  are the simplest moulds to deal with. They are best suited to the pour casting 
  method. One must be careful not to leave air spaces in areas such as long noses 
  and chins when filling up with latex. In order to avoid large air pockets of 
  this kind, the mould should be tipped on one side carefully, whilst the latex 
  is being poured to encourage it into these areas.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><u><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Painting</span></u><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>There are really no paints that will adhere to latex 
  permanently and take any continual abrasion. There are specialist Neoprene based 
  paints available, but they are very expensive, must be bought in bulk and can 
  tend to be dangerous to work with. Acrylic paints tend to be the best compromise. 
  If a small amount of specialist carpet adhesive such as Carpetwise (a water 
  based strong rubber carpet adhesive) is added to the paint, it will add flexibility 
  and additional adhesive qualities to the acrylic. The mask can then be treated 
  in the same way as a model. Various tones of colour can be dry brushed onto 
  the surface, and for the more adventurous, the recesses and undertones can be 
  Airbrushed to add realism etc. Thin washes may also be employed to pick out 
  fine detail.  </p>
