    <td width="690" colspan="2">This was an individual commission for a&nbsp; full costume,
    including armour and weaponry, inspired by the Predator films. A full electronic system
    was incorporated within the suit to power the lasers in the removable helmet (left hand of
    the Pred' in the picture on the right),&nbsp; pyrotechnic shoulder mounted gun, light and
    sound effects. A Pneumatic (compressed air) system was employed for the real time
    operating claw weapon.</td>

      <h2>For your information</h2>
      <p>Second Skin, now Hybrid Enterprises don't make/sell Predator costumes 
        or<br>
        parts thereof as a general rule due to licensing laws...the one above 
        was made<br>
        when trading as Second Skin some years ago and was a one off project, 
        to<br>
        fit a specific customer and friend of the designers. Although they do 
        still<br>
        have moulds for the chest, hands, feet and head, the rest was scratch 
        built,<br>
        with electronics and pneumatics included to make it all function as<br>
        naturally as possible in real time.</p>
      <p>A fresh copy which would have to be custom made to fit the client, would<br>
        unfortunately be very expensive. You may be aware that work such as this 
        has<br>
        a great deal of time, skill and effort invested in it. Accurate life casts<br>
        of the customer must first be made, followed by a great deal of sculpture,<br>
        moulding and fabrication work, as well as many specialised fittings to<br>
        accomplish the final effect. A rough cost estimate on a copy of the suit<br>
        would be upward of &pound;40,000 (pounds sterling).</p>
