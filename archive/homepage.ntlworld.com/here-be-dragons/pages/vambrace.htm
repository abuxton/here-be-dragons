<h2>Equipment</h2>
<font FACE="Arial"><i><b></b></i> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Soft leather</b> (either soft skins, or suitable sized pieces cut from 
    a leather coat etc) </li>
  <li><b>Eyelets </b></li>
  <li><b>Glue</b> (a thixotropic type, such as &quot;Thixofix&quot; is best, as 
    it spreads easily and doesn&#146;t dry out too fast in the can so lasts longer) 
  </li>
  <li><b>A craft knife </b>(the small snap off retractable/lockable type)</li>
  <li>Ruler (preferably metal to cut against) </li>
  <li><b>White or metallic ink roller ball pen or white pencil</b>, for making 
    the leather </li>
  <li><b>Studs etc to decorate </b></li>
  <li><b>Tape measure </b></li>
  <li><b>Cord</b> (obtainable from a haberdashery shop/department) for trimming 
    the edges and lacing up the vambrace &#150; you will probably want to buy 
    some in several different thicknesses </li>
  <li><b>Newspaper or brown paper</b> with which to make a pattern</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making a Pattern</h2>
</b></i>

<p>When your arm is bent, measure 

<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(a) from wrist to elbow on inside of arm <br>
      (b) around the wrist <br>
      (c) around the forearm, just under the elbow </p>
    </blockquote>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Using these measurements make a paper pattern shape as shown </p>
</font>

<p><img SRC="../images/vambrace1.gif" width="319" height="294"></p>
<font FACE="Arial">

<p>The curve at the top compensates for curves in the arm and allows for the fact that the
wrist to elbow is longer on the outside of the arm than on the inside and if the pattern
is too long along edge (a) it is extremely uncomfortable. The curve on the bottom edge (b)
makes for a comfier fit at the wrist. You will probably need to experiment with the curves
to get at (a) and (b) until you have a pattern that is a good fit on <b>your</b> arm. It
is worth taking the time to get it right.</p>

<p>Draw round this pattern on the inside of the soft leather you have chosen, using the
roller ball or white pencil. If you&#146;re using a pencil wet the lead frequently for
ease of use. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draw another line around the vambrace shape at least an inch or more away, 
  to make the piece of leather an inch larger all the way around. This is to allow 
  for fold overs to strengthen the eyelet edge and leave room to glue in cord 
  at the wrist and elbow edges. The amount of turnover you require will depend 
  on the thickness of cord you have chosen. You will also need to cut off the 
  corners for ease of folding </p>

<h2>Making the Vambrace</h2>
</b></i> 
<p>Cut out the large vambrace shape with either a craft knife of pair of scissors. 
  Then pare down all the edges, using a craft knife. This makes the edges thinner 
  and blend in without giving an uncomfortable ridge when you fold them over and 
  stick them down</p>
<p>Cut a piece of cord slightly shorter than curve on edge (b) and another just 
  shorter than the curve on edge (c). I often use quite thin cord around the wrist 
  edge, and a thicker cord (up to about 1cm diameter) for the elbow edge. It's 
  best to mark your cord with pen, then tightly wrap about an inch and a half 
  of sellotape around the cord, so you can see your mark in the middle of the 
  tape. Just cut, at an angle, through the tape and cord together with a craft 
  knife, the sellotape will stop the cord fraying. </p>
<p>Apply glue to the wrist and elbow inside edges of the vambrace from the edge 
  to about two inches in. Place the cords on the inner wrist and elbow lines and 
  glue over these. Let the glue dry until it is tacky, then fold edges down over 
  the cord on the inside, and smooth the edges up to the cord on the right side, 
  pressing down on the right side to get a nice three effect with the cord. You 
  may need to make small slashes in the turn over (try not to cut in too far) 
  to stick the edges down and lie flat . This gives a nice neat rolled edge at 
  wrist and elbow. </p>
<p>Glue down the side edges (a) in the same way, but omitting the cord. </p>
<p>You should now have a nice vambrace-shaped piece of leather, the same size 
  as your pattern. </p>
<p>Now decorate the vambrace with rivets, studs, eyelets and appliqué etc to your 
  taste. </p>

<h2>The Lining</h2>
</b></i> 
<p>The next step is to line the vambrace, to give it extra strength and cover 
  the back of any rivets, studs etc, to stop them digging into your arm. </p>
<p>Cut out another vambrace piece to the exact size of your pattern in thin soft 
  leather. Trim all the edges by about 0.5cm. Pare down all the edges on the shiny 
  side of the leather; the suede side is usually nicest next to the skin. </p>
<p>Glue the inside of the vambrace and the shiny side of the lining, and leave 
  the glue to dry until it is tacky. Then stick the vambrace and lining together, 
  stretching the lining slightly so it just comes to the edge of the vambrace 
  and blends in nicely. </p>

<h2>Finishing</h2>
</b></i> 
<p>The next step is to put eyelets in the edges (a). I find 5 or 7 eyelets to 
  a side is good. Then lace up the vambrace and put it on! (- the eyeleted edges 
  go on the inner forearm)</p>

<h2>Vambrace for Shooting</h2>
</b></i> 
<p>If you want to make a vambrace to protect your bow arm when shooting you will 
  need to make it a little shorter along edge (a) as this will be on your inner 
  forearm and the vambrace laced up on the outside. I also find it best not to 
  decorate it, as studs etc may catch on your bowstring. Other than that, the 
  method is as above.</p>
